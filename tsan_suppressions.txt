# ThreadSanitizer suppressions for memtier_benchmark
#
# This file contains suppressions for known benign data races that do not
# affect correctness. These races are intentionally left unfixed for performance.

# Benign race on stats counters during progress display
# Worker threads update stats while main thread reads them for progress updates.
# This is benign because:
# - Progress stats are approximate and for display only
# - Final results are collected after pthread_join (race-free)
# - Adding synchronization would hurt performance

# OpenSSL internal races (false positives in libcrypto)
# These are known benign races within OpenSSL library itself
